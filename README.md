# Stock market trader
This Python-based stock trading program facilitates clients in buying and selling stocks, leveraging various built-in modules like socket, threading, and json. The server module listens for client connections, processes orders, maintains traded stocks, and fetches real-time stock prices from a third-party API. Here's how it works:
The server listens for connections on a specified IP address and port, handling each client connection in a new thread via the `handle_client` function. Upon client connection, the server receives JSON-encoded buy and sell orders, appending them to a global list of traded stocks. Additionally, it prints out the updated list using the `print_traded_stocks` function.
To retrieve real-time stock prices, the server employs the `get_stock_prices` function, which interacts with the third-party API via HTTP GET requests. It parses the JSON response to extract current stock prices and sends them to clients as a JSON-encoded dictionary.
On the client side, a client socket connects to the server and sends buy orders as a JSON-encoded string. Subsequently, it enters a loop to receive and print real-time stock updates from the server.
Overall, this project offers a robust platform for real-time stock trading, efficiently processing orders and providing clients with up-to-date stock information. Its modular design allows for easy customization and expansion to meet diverse user needs.
Software requirements include Python 3.x, a third-party API key for fetching real-time stock prices, and a stable network connection for communication between server and client components.
